Answers to the assignment questions:

1. I chose the Verdana font family.
2. I chose this font family because I like the clean shapes of the letters, the uniform kerning (letter spacing), and the professional look and feel.
3. I have a portfolio page on my business website, so I created a super basic page for this assignment. My page on GitHub is Cheryl-Landes-Portfolio-Website.html, and the portfolio page on my business website is https://tabbycatco.com/portfolio.
